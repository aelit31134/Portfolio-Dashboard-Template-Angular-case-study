# Portfolio-Dashboard-Template-Angular-case-study
A simple Dashboard template built in angular, can act as a base for building any type of dashboard application using angular.

##Front-End
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng serve --port 8081` after integrating with backend as CORS is configured for port 8081.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
